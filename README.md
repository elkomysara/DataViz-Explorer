## Usage

1. **Upload a Dataset**: On the home page, upload a CSV file that you want to explore.
2. **Visualize the Data**: After uploading, you'll be redirected to the visualization page where the data is displayed in interactive charts.
3. **Apply Filters**: Use filters (date range, categories) to adjust the visualized data based on your preferences.
4. **Explore**: Zoom in/out, pan through the data, and download visualized results for further analysis.
